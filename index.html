        <p>
          Play to learn, play to practice, and you will win when you play in
          games. Remember how much fun you had growing up when you used to just
          go outside and play with your friends? We advocate using the "compete
          to learn" approach to practice--it lets kids play and have fun while
          competing. This type of practice, using competitive drills, does a
          better job of preparing players to compete in real games. Technically,
          this is called transference. What you do in practice carries over into
          what you do in games.

        <h1>Program Mission & Goals</h1>
        <p>
          Want to improve your team's ball handling? Games like dribble knockout
          are very popular. Every player must have his or her own basketball.
          Coach starts the game. Every player must dribble constantly, stay
          in-bounds and try to knock the ball away from all other players in the
          game. Lose control of your basketball or go out-of-bounds, and you're
          eliminated. Boundaries for 10-12 players could start as half the
          court. After several players are eliminated, the boundary is reduced
          to only inside the 3-point area. Boundary is reduced again to the
          free-throw lane. Finally, when there are just two players left, they
          play the "finals" in the free throw half circle.

              and played collegiately and professionally in the ABA and UBA. He
              has run training camps for the Cleveland Cavaliers and Utah Jazz

              experience. Most importantly, his demeanor and positivity working
