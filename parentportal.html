          <p>
            Tuesdays and Thursdays @ 5pm. FIRST PRACTICE THIS THURSDAY AT 5PM.
            Possibility of Mondays at 4:30pm as an alternate day if that is
            better for families' schedules. Please let me know of any
            preferences.

          <h2>Games</h2>
          <p>
            Smith is working with SF house to arrange games. It may be sporadic
            in the beginning as they are looking for a coach, but we should be
            able to have scrimmages and games with the other teams that have
            coaches. We will eventually look to have games weekly, preferably
            Saturdays.
          </p>
          <h2>Tournaments</h2>
          <p>
            We are looking to play in 1-2 tournaments before the summer. We will
            gauge readiness and family schedules, but looking at the end of
            April (Spring Championship) and mid-May (Spring Finale). These dates
            are definitely not set, not-mandatory, but we view them as a great
            way to expose our kids to different levels of the sport from
            different cities/regions.
