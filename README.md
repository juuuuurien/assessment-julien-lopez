# Julien Lopez's 2Leaf Assessment Project

Hi! First and foremost, I would like to say thank you all so much for taking a chance on me!
<br />
I hope this project is a true representation of my skill as a developer. I tried to hit every mark on
the prompt and worked very hard for it to look pretty, so please let me know how I did!
</br>
</br>
Thank you,
</br>
Julien

## Running Express server

To serve some backend code, I chose Node.js and Express, with nodemon for auto save refreshes. To run the local server run:

    nodemon express.js

in your terminal. This will run the express server to http://localhost:8080/
