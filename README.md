# Julien Lopez's 2Leaf Assessment Project

Hi! First and foremost, I would like to say thank you all so much for taking a chance on me!
`<br />`
I hope this project is a true representation of my skill as a developer. I tried to hit every mark on
the prompt and worked very hard for it to look pretty, so please let me know how I did!

Thank you,

## Installing dependencies

To run the app, please clone, download, and install the package dependencies (nodemon node and express).
`</br>`
(I think this is correct, I've never instructed anyone on how to download and run my apps locally)

    > git clone https://github.com/juuuuurien/assessment-julien-lopez.git
    > npm install

## Running Express server

To serve some backend code, I chose Node.js and Express, with nodemon for auto save refreshes. To run the local server run:

    > npm start

in your terminal. This will run the express server to http://localhost:8080/
